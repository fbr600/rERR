# rERR package

fit Excess Relative Risk model

## Getting Started

In radiation epidemiology, ERR models are used to analyze dose-response relationships for event rate data.

Usual approaches to the analysis of cohort and case control data often follow from risk-set sampling designs, where at each failure 
time a new risk set is defined, including the index case and all the controls that were at risk at that time. That kind of sampling designs are usually related to the 
Cox proportional hazards model, available in most standard statistical packages but limited to log-linear models.

One model of particular interest, especially in radiation environmental and occupational epidemiology is the ERR model,
